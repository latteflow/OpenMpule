# OpenMpule
A 3-D printed device to open an Ampoule.

## Problem Statement 
Recently, on YouTube, I came across a video showing an ampoule being snapped, during which a few glass shards fall into the medicine. Generally, the needle diameter is smaller than the glass shard particles, so they don't get drawn into the syringe with the medicine and are not a health hazard. There are special syringes with disposable infusion filters to prevent this. However, smaller particles still have a chance of being sucked into the syringe. Additionally, when snapping the ampoule, nurses or doctors sometimes accidentally injure themselves. This made me wonder if there is a better way to break the ampoule without letting any glass fall into the medicine. 

## Objectives 
1. It must be 3D printable and/or inexpensive to produce.
2. It should break the ampoule cleanly without allowing glass particles to fall into the medicine.
3. It must not come into contact with the medicine, and the breaking process should prevent spillage.
4. Ideally, it should be compatible with ampoules of various shapes and sizes.
