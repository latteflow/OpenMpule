## Problem Statement 
Recently, On YouTube, I came across a video where an ampoule is snapped, and a few pieces of glass shards produced during this process fall into the medicine. Generally, the needle diameter is less than the size of the glass shard particles. It doesn't get sucked with medicine into the syringe and it is not a health hazard. There are special syringes with disposable infusion filters. However, the smaller particle still has the chance to be sucked by the syringe. Also, when snapping the ampoule, nurses or doctors sometimes accidentally hurt themselves. So I came to wonder if there is a better to break the ampoule without letting any piece of glass fall into the medicine. 

## Objectives: 
1. It has to be 3D printable/cheap 
2. It breaks the ampoule without letting any particles fall into the medicine
3. It does not come in any contact with the medicine. During the breaking procedure, the medicine in the vile should not spill
4. It can be used to open ampoules of all shapes and sizes (maybe)
