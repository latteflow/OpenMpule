# Ampule
A 3-D printed device to open an ampule


## Problem Statement 
Recently, I was watching a YouTube video and came across this video. 
When an ampule is snapped, a few pieces of glass shards produced during this process fall into the medicine. Generally, the needle diameter is less than the shared particle size, and it is not a health hazard. However, the smaller particle has still the chance to be sucked by the needle. There are other better ways to prevent the particle from going into the syringe such as a disposable infusion filter. 

So I came to wonder if there is a better to break the ampule without letting any piece of glass fall into the medicine. 

Let's figure out. 


Our Objective: 
1. It has to be 3D printable
2. It breaks the ampule without letting any particles fall into the medicine
3. The device does not come in any contact with the medicine
4. It has to be cheap
5. During the breaking procedure, the medicine in the vile does not spill
